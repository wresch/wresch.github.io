[Slides](/assets/100610_python_pipelines.pdf) of a presentation I gave on using python generators
and coroutines for setting up data flow through pipelines.  The
[example code](https://bitbucket.org/wresch/example-code-for-generator-coroutine-pipeline-presentation/overview) is available from bitbucket.

This was heavily inspired by the excellent presentations of
[David Beazley](http://www.dabeaz.com/coroutines/).
