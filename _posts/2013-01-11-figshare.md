title:  figshare - sharing (unlimited) information publicly with a doi

[Figshare](http://figshare.com) seems to allow sharing any size of
data publicly and assigns a
[DOI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier) for
citation. Content is hosted on Amazon S3 and archived at different
research libraries. The combination of a DOI and third party storage
should avoid the URL-rot that befalls many published URLs pointing to
lab/university web sites for code or data. One possibility would be to
create a virtual machine image containing all code and data needed to
re-capitulate a published analysis. Or one could use the (linux only)
[CDE tool]({% post_url 2012-12-06-cde-for-reproducible-research %}) i
posted about earlier.
